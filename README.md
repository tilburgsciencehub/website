[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f811bd2e-cf5d-4f1c-8688-0c2fee482141/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tsh-website/deploys)

Tilburg Science Hub (TSH) is an open-source online resource that helps individual researchers, data scientists, and teams to efficiently carry out data- and computation-intensive projects. It provides information about workflow and data management and tutorials that teach researchers how to organize and document their data and code, so the research becomes sustainable and reproducible. This in turn leads to time savings and transparency in the process.

We provide the tools and guidance to be in control and save time in your empirical research projects.

## Why was Tilburg Science Hub (TSH) developed?
We see two major reasons why it pays off to use professional tools to carry out empirical projects. First, the initial investment pays off very quickly. There are many tools that are tremendously helpful and many things can be automated, which also helps to avoid errors. Second, it increases transparency and contributes to reaching the goal of making science reproducible.

## Our pillars

### Conventions make the difference
Learn to write clean code, use conventions and version control to catch mistakes easily, make your work future-proof, and allow others to quickly review it.

### Onboarding made easy
Learn how to make teamwork exciting, not only efficient! Use SCRUM and collaboration tools to assign roles, manage tasks, and define milestones so that nobody is left behind.

### Automate your project
Learn to automate your research workflow. Don't waste time manually running each step. Let your computer take care of it for you, while you can work on something else and don't just wait behind a screen.

### Scale it up if you need more power
When the going gets tough, the tough get cloud computing. Learn to quickly resume your work running instances on remote servers.

## What does TSH offer?
Many of us face the same dilemma. We know that a small investment will have big returns, but we put off making it because we lack the time to make it now. TSH makes it easier to make this investment now by providing:

- information about all one needs to know to get started
- tutorials
- example workflows
- starter code

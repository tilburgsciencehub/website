# Exporting Data
Finally, it's time to turn our generated files into plots which we can use for our analysis. First, we create the R scripts to create the plots. Second, we automate the entire pipeline using `make`. 


**plot_all.R**  
A time-series plot that shows the total number of reviews over time (across all neighborhoods). Add a plot title and axes labels to make your graph easier to read. Store it as `plot_all.pdf` in `gen/plots` (don't forget to add a `plots` folder in `gen`!).

* Import the data from `gen/data-preparation/aggregated_df.csv`
* Convert the `date` column into date format.
* Group by date and calculate the sum of all reviews across neighourhoods.
* Plot the chart and store the visualisation.

**plot_Amsterdam.R**  
A time-series plot that shows the total number of reviews over time for the top 3 neighborhoods (Centrum-West, De Pijp - Rivierenbuurt, and De Baarsjes - Oud-West). Add a plot title, axes labels, and a legend to make your graph easier to read. Store it as `plot_Amsterdam.pdf` in `gen/plots`.

* Import the data from `gen/data-preparation/pivot_table.csv`
* Convert the `date` column into date format.
* Plot the chart and store the visualisation.

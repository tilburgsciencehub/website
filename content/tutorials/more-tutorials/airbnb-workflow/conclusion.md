# Conclusion
Study the output files and formulate an answer to our initial research question as well as the following subquestions:

* Did all neighbourhoods in Amsterdam suffer equally from the pandemic? 
* Why is the number of listings in December 2020 remarkably low? 
* Discuss the methods you can use to test whether the identified relationship is statistically significant. How would you define the regression model? (no need to implement it here!)
* Comment on the limitations of our approach and come up with strategies to overcome them.

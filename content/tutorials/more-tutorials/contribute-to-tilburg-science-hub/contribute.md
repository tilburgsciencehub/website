## How to contribute to Tilburg Science Hub

We're glad for your interest in contributing to our project. Tilburg Science Hub is open-source, and as such, **anyone** can contribute! The process is really simple.

You are welcome to contribute to our platform in two ways.

### Create a new GitHub Issue

Head over to [our issue page on GitHub](https://github.com/tilburgsciencehub/website/issues/new/choose) to let us know about bugs, feature requests for the website, or anything that you would love to see developed for your research project (e.g., a code snippet). You can also attach files.

### Contribute directly via Pull Requests

Already familiar with GitHub and Pull Requests? Than [fork our repository](https://github.com/tilburgsciencehub/website/fork), work on your changes in a fresh branch, and submit a pull request.

Need a step-by-step tutorial on how to do that? [Read more about pull requests here](../pullrequests).

## What is a contribution?

Anything from simple changes, grammar checks and reporting a bug to more elaborate changes and writing entirely new content!

We basically welcome **any** kind of feedback and contribution, including but not limited to:

- general fixes (typos, small sentences)
- elaborate changes (modifying, adding or removing an entire paragraph or chapter)
- asking for new content to be added
- submitting an article without worrying about formatting (even a Word file!)
- reporting a bug
- requesting a new feature on the website
- general tips or questions on the project


## How is the content organized?

We provide content in three forms:

- **Building Blocks** are concepts in small doses, the DNA of our platform. They are small code snippets that users can independently "mix" to create something unique, like LEGO bricks. These allow us to explain the theory while also providing some practical examples and code snippets for a variety of programming languages or operating systems. Information is explained in a way that it is easy to clone or implement in an existing project. While everybody can follow our Building Blocks, they are generally more appealing to advanced users – or those who already know what to look for.

- **Tutorials** explain a broader argument compared to Building Blocks, and follow a sequential order. They teach our users how to combine individual building blocks into a "final product". These are particularly useful for novices or anyone new to a certain topic because of their comprehensive nature and step-by-step guidance. We support and encourage the use of videos, exercises, and quizzes in a tutorial.

- **Examples** are real-life cases, publications, templates, or research projects that put into practice the concepts explained on this website.

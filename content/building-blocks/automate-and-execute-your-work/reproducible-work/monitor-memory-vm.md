## Overview

In any computational environment, monitoring and managing memory allocation is crucial. Regardless of how advanced or powerful your machine might be, there are always potential bottlenecks, especially when working with memory-intensive tasks. 

In this guide, we delve deep into:

- **Memory Monitoring Tools:** Equip yourself with tools like `htop` and `nvtop` to keep an eye on your system's performance in real-time.

- **Strategies for Handling Memory Issues:** Learn hands-on strategies, from batching to efficient algorithm choices, to avert memory-related setbacks. We'll also touch upon a real-case example using the BERT model in PyTorch to exemplify how memory can be optimized in machine learning scenarios.

**Linux for Virtual Machines**

The commands `htop` and `nvtop` are designed for Linux-based environments (such as Ubuntu or Debian) given their widespread use in virtual machine contexts due to their open-source nature, robust security, and versatility.

## Handling memory allocation issues

It's not uncommon for systems to run out of memory, especially when dealing with large datasets or computation-heavy processes. When a system can't allocate required memory, it can result in runtime errors. 

While the straightforward solution might seem to be upgrading hardware, it isn't always feasible. Hence, the necessity to monitor and manage memory efficiently.

### Monitor resources usage

A crucial part of managing any computational task is continuously monitoring your system's resource usage. This way, you can promptly identify potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies and address them proactively.

As introduced before, [htop](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop) and [nvtop](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop) are two widely used tools for tracking CPU and GPU usage, respectively.

`htop` is an interactive process viewer and system monitor. It's similar to the `top` command but provides a more visually appealing and human-readable format.
It allows us to sort by the task we're most interested in monitoring by pressing `F6`, among other interesting features.

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../img/htop2.png" width="1000" style="border:1px solid black;">
<figcaption> htop command down-display running tasks sorted by memory consumption </figcaption>
</p>

To install `htop` in your VM instance, you can use the following command:

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
$ sudo apt install htop
# or:
$ sudo apt-get install htop
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

You can then run `htop` by simply typing `htop` in your terminal.

Similarly, `nvtop` stands for **NVIDIA GPUs TOP**. It's an interactive [NVIDIA GPU](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html#ubuntu-lts) usage viewer for Unix-like systems, including **Ubuntu**, and it's a must-have tool for anyone using GPU-accelerated tasks.

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../img/nvtop-user.png" width="700" style="border:1px solid black;">
<figcaption> nvtop command display of GPUs resources usage</figcaption>
</p>

You can install nvtop using the following commands:

{{% codeblock %}}

```bash
$ sudo apt install nvtop
# or:
$ sudo apt-get install nvtop
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

With `nvtop`, you can monitor GPU usage by typing `nvtop` into your terminal.

Use `htop` and `nvtop` to keep an eye on your resource usage. If you notice your system is running out of memory or your GPU utilization is too high, it's a good idea to take steps to address the issue before it leads to a crash.

**Back-ups**

Overloading system memory can lead to unsaved data loss. Regularly save your work during memory-intensive tasks.

### Practical approaches 

There are several practical solutions to avoid running out of memory. These are some common strategies:

- **Batching:** When working with large datasets, especially in machine learning scenarios, it's efficient to break the task into smaller chunks. For demonstration purposes, we'll use a BERT model in PyTorch. BERT is a large neural network model that can easily consume memory, making it a good example for this discussion.

In PyTorch, the `DataLoader` class facilitates batching:

{{% example %}}
In **PyTorch**, the `DataLoader` class can implement batching. An illustration of creating a `DataLoader` for a text dataset, using a tokenizer for a **BERT** model, is shown below:

    from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

    class TextDataset(Dataset):
        def __init__(self, texts, tokenizer, max_length):
            self.texts = texts
            self.tokenizer = tokenizer
            self.max_length = max_length

        def __len__(self):
            return len(self.texts)

        def __getitem__(self, idx):
            text = self.texts[idx]
            encoding = self.tokenizer(
                text,
                max_length=self.max_length,
                padding='max_length',
                truncation=True,
                return_tensors='pt'
            )
            return encoding

    # Create Dataset instance
    dataset = TextDataset(full_df['commenttext'].tolist(), tokenizer, max_length)

    # Configure your batch size according to your hardware resources
    batch_size = 32

    # DataLoader parameter shuffle is set to false by default to avoid mixing values
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size)

    # Change path to read the saved models from data/Labeled_Responses/Models

    # Load model
    bert_sc_pa = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
        dir +'/model_BERT_pa1')

    # Inference
    bert_sc_pa.eval()
    predictions_pa = []

    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch in dataloader:
            input_ids = batch['input_ids'].squeeze()
            attention_mask = batch['attention_mask'].squeeze()
            
            output = bert_sc_pa(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
            
            scores = output.logits
            predicted_pa = torch.argmax(scores, dim=1).cpu().numpy()
            predictions_pa.extend(predicted_pa)

Adjusting the `batch_size` parameter balances memory usage against processing time. A smaller `batch_size` reduces memory usage but may increase processing time.

- **Efficient Data Structures and Algorithms:** A wise choice in data structures and algorithm design can substantially cut down memory usage. The selection depends on your data's nature and your go-to operations. 

{{% example %}}
Take hash tables as an example, they boast constant time complexity for search operations, becoming a superior option for substantial datasets. 

In Python, this translates to choosing dictionaries over lists when wrestling with large datasets:

<figcaption> Dictionaries are more efficient data structures than lists</figcaption>
</p>

- **Parallelizing your Work:** Divide the task among multiple identical instances, each running a part of the code. This approach is particularly useful when your code involves training or using multiple machine-learning models. For instance, instead of running three BERT models sequentially on one instance, distribute them across three instances.

Remember that beyond these strategies, it's always possible to leverage the scalability and flexibility of cloud services such as Google Cloud. These services allow for a dynamic allocation of resources according to your needs.

## Overview

[{{< katex >}}\LaTeX{{< /katex >}}](https://www.latex-project.org) is a professional typesetting system widely used in academia. It produces great-looking journal articles, technical reports, books, and even slide presentations.

One of its main features is that **it separates the writing and the formatting stages**. The writer can focus solely on writing the content in plain text, and then use some markup tags and commands to stylize the text and define the document structure.

This is mainly what sets $\LaTeX$ apart from WYSIWYG (an acronym for "What You See Is What You Get") editors, like Microsoft Word. Experienced users can **produce professional-looking documents very quickly**, but **at the expense of losing a Graphical User Interface**.

## Meet LyX

**[LyX](https://www.lyx.org)** is a document preparation software that bridges the two worlds of "What You See Is What You Mean" and "What You See Is What You Get". It combines the power and flexibility of $\LaTeX$ with a Graphical User Interface and the gentle learning curve of editors like Microsoft Word.

LyX is cross-platform and free of charge. You can download it from the **[LyX Download page](https://www.lyx.org/Download)**.

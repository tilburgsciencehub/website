## Overview

Welcome to this introductory guide for Git and GitHub. In this building block, we'll help you with the essential skills to start using Git for version control and start collaborating effectively on coding projects. 

The building block consists of the following sections:
- What is Git?
- What is GitHub? 
- Configuring Git on a new computer
- Creating or joining repositories
- "Workcycles" to track your changes
- Branching

By the end of this building block, you'll have a solid grasp of Git and GitHub, empowering you to manage code versions and collaborate confidently with fellow developers.

### What is Git?

**Git** is an open-source version control system that allows you to keep track of your source files, and the changes you make to them. Using Git you can roll back to any previous version of a file, and easily collaborate with team members. Git runs on your computer and allows you to configure so-called repositories that track files and directories. Use our building block [Set up Git and Github](/building-blocks/configure-your-computer/statistics-and-computation/git/) to install Git and Github!

### What is GitHub?

You can optionally use Git in combination with an online hosting service such as [**GitHub**](https://www.github.com), which allows you to back up your code, synchronize your work across multiple computers, or collaborate with others on joint projects. There are several alternatives to GitHub available, and maybe your institution even offers its own "Git" services.

On top of the basic features of Git (like versioning), GitHub offers a range of tools
that allow you to collaborate more efficiently. A few examples are:
- *Issues* are like to-do lists, flavored with a discussion board.
- *Projects* are akin to a [*Scrum board*](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/how-to-use-scrum-board-for-agile-development/). It facilitates project management, allowing for task allocation and progress tracking.

### Configuring Git on a new computer

To use Git on your local machine, tell Git your name and email address. This way, any work you do (and potentially sync later) can be linked to your name.

Open `Git bash`, and type the following commands:

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
# Set the author name for your commits
git config --global user.name "[Your Name]"

# Set the author email for your commits
git config --global user.email "[your.email@example.com]"
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

This ensures every contribution you make is uniquely recognized and properly linked to you. 

### Creating or joining repositories

Git organizes your code in so-called repositories. You can either create a repository for new or existing projects or join existing repositories. Keep on reading to find out how.

#### Create a new repository for a new project

If you would like to start a new project, it's easiest to start
your repository from one of our [example projects](/examples). 

- If it is a template project, navigate to a project’s GitHub page, and select *Use this template* (a green button). Choose a name for your new repository, and proceed with the standard options. Note down the URL for your repository (e.g., `https://github.com/tilburgsciencehub/test-repository`).

For example, this [example-make-workflow](https://github.com/rgreminger/example-make-workflow) can be used as a template directly:

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/exampletemplateproject.png" width="500">
</p>

- If it is not a template project, you can fork the repository. Forking creates your copy of a repository. For example, this example workflow can be forked with the "fork" button on the upper right of the page:

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/exampleforking.png" width="500">
</p>

#### Create a new repository for an existing project

The chance is you are already working on a project, and you'd like to adopt
Git to start versioning your files from now onwards.

Just navigate to your main project directory, open `Git bash`, and
type

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
# initialize a new repository
git init
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

#### Clone an existing repository to your local computer

If you already have your own GitHub repository or have become a member of the GitHub repository of a team member, you can just "clone" these repositories to your local computer.

```bash
# clone an existing repository from Github to local PC
git clone "[url]"

# clone an existing repository, and specify name of target directory on local PC
git clone "url" my-project # will clone the repository to the folder `my-project`.

```

{{% tip %}}
**Cloning to start with example code**

Cloning is a fantastic way to use the work of others to start your own. For example, you can type `git clone "https://github.com/rgreminger/example-make-workflow"` to clone a copy of the example workflow using R and make (see also the [example projects](/examples)).

You can also take a sneak preview of one of the thousands of projects hosted on GitHub. Just note down the
URL of the repository (e.g., `https://github.com/[username]/[project-name]`), and clone the repository to your local computer.

**Storing repositories best practices**

- Avoid storing your project deep within many sub-directories, but rather higher up in your folder hierarchy (e.g. 'D/projects'). This is because Git Bash cannot handle file paths over a certain number of characters. 
- Avoid complicated directory names, so you can navigate quickly to them. In this example, the folder is named `my-project`.
- Avoid storing your Git repositories on Dropbox or Drive as this may lead to synchronization conflicts.

### "Workcycles" to track your changes

When working on your project, you do the following two things:
- Make changes to your project (e.g., such as adding, removing, or changing source files),
- Synchronize your repository with GitHub, so that (a) you make a backup of your changes, (b) you allow other team members to see your changes, and (c) you see changes that team members have done.

![Git workflow.](../git_workflow.png)

#### Track your changes

- Now it's time to start working on your project. "Working" means making changes to files or directories (such as adding, changing, or deleting files or directories).

- Typically, you execute this workflow multiple times a day when working on a project. Every time you execute this workflow, you "save" a snapshot of your project that
you can roll back to later.

- Git separates a "save" operation into two stages: first, files (or directories) can be
gathered on a so-called "staging area" using the command `git add`. You can use multiple
of these commands after each other. Then, in a second step, the changes are saved - or, in Git terminology - "committed". The command for this is `git commit`. See below for an example, which also adds a few other useful commands.

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
# show files or directories that were changed (or that still need to be added)
# files that are already in the staging area are green; files that are not
# in the staging area are red.
git status

# add a directory or file to the staging area
git add directory-name-or-file-name
# for example, git add sourcecode.R, or dir-name/sourcecode.R.

# run git status again, to see that the files have "turned green"
git status

# added a wrong file to the staging area, and want it to turn "red" again?
git reset directory-name-or-file-name

# are you happy with what is green in your staging area? Then it's
# time to finalize your save operation by initiating a so-called "commit".
git commit -m "message"
# (give it a clear message, so that you can easily roll back to this version
# of your repository.

# optionally, use git log to see the versioning history
git log
```

**Exclude or remove files from tracking**

Want to avoid tracking specific files and folders from versioning? For example, there is no point in tracking *generated files* in `/gen`, as these files are purely created based on source code in `/src` (which, in
turn, you *do* would like to track). Also, large data sets shouldn't be versioning, given the upload limit at GitHub. Learn how to exclude files and directories from tracking in this [building block](../git-ignore).

Similarly, you should not store any sensitive information (such as passwords or API keys) in your code. Similarly, you may have accidentally committed a large data set and would like to take it out of the repository entirely. This [building block](../remove-files.md) teaches you how to remove sensitive or large files from your repository.

#### Synchronize your changes with a server
Everyone can sync their local changes with the remote repository on GitHub. You can also "download" changes to your local repository from the remote repository.

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
# (1) DOWNLOAD AND MERGE CHANGES

# download and merge any changes from the remote/GitHub
git pull

# alternatively, you can do the same in two steps:
git fetch # fetches changes
git merge # merges changes with your local files

# (2) UPLOAD CHANGES

# upload all local branch commits to GitHub
git push
```

### Branching

Branches separate the main version of your project (the "main" branch) from any experimental code in which you develop new features. Branches allow team members to make changes to the project without immediately affecting the main version of the project. 

We provide an introduction to branching and branch naming strategies in additional building blocks:

*  [Git Branching Strategies](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/collaborate-and-share-your-work/use-github/git-branching-strategies/). This building block explains several Git Branching Strategies and its own set of advantages and disadvantages.
*  [Best Practices for Naming Git Branches](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/collaborate-and-share-your-work/use-github/naming-git-branches/). This building block covers useful practices for naming branches to ensure a clear and structured repository.

1. We distinguish between **local** and **remote** repositories.
    - Each project can consist of multiple local repositories, which are stored on one or many computers (e.g., your desktop PC, your laptop, a computer in a cloud, or computers by team members).
    - Each project typically has one remote repository (e.g., hosted on GitHub), which is used to backup and synchronize changes between multiple computers.

2. Each project has a "working tree" (your project's main directory) - by default, all files in that working directory can be tracked.

3. Workflow to version your files
    - Run `git status` to see which files are staged (green), and which ones are not (red)
    - Add files to the 'staging area', using the command `git add`
    - Run `git status` to verify you have tracked everything you want.
    - See files and/or directories that you never want to track? Add those to a `.gitignore` file (typically data files, or generated output files)
    - Finalize your "save" by running `git commit -m "give yourself a clear message "`, which will commit any changes to your project's history.
4. Workflow to synchronize changes with a remote repository
    - Run `git pull`; alternatively, first run `git fetch` and then `git merge`
    - Push (`git push`) your own local changes to the repository (so that others see your changes)
5. Other useful commands
    - Use `git checkout` to switch branches
    - Use `git clone` to clone repositories from GitHub -->

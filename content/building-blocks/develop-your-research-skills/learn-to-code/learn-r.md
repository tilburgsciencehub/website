## Why R?

- Chance is that sooner or later, you're going to use R, one of the (if not *the*) most popular statistical
programming languages in the world. It's not only that R is free which makes
it so good, but because thousands of people across the world use it, document it, and
develop it further.

  The R interface may be scary at first sight, especially if you're used to using Excel to do your data magic. But trust us, investing in learning R will pay off greatly. Not only for your career at grad school, but also for your career in industry. R (next to Python) has been a de-facto standard when applying for jobs in marketing analytics or data science.

 - One thing that's great about R is that **there are tons of resources available**
to learn it. Well - that brings the difficulty that you need to know which
resources to use to learn it most efficiently.



## **Learn R fast**
{{% tip %}}


Here are a few tips to learn R efficiently.

- Have a project!

  "Huh - why to have a project? I first need to learn R!"

  Well, if you *really* want to learn R, then you should already have a project in mind that you would like to tackle. R is such a powerful tool that you would get entirely lost if you didn't actually know what you would like to accomplish.
  If you don't have a project, and still would like to learn R, we suggest you to do some googling for some interesting datasets to get you started (e.g., [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)).

- Follow our [R/R Studio installation guide](/building-blocks/configure-your-computer/statistics-and-computation/r/)
- Enroll R courses at Datacamp.com (free-to-use with a Tilburg University account!)
  - Must do's for **novices**
      - [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)
      - [Intermediate R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r)
  - Must do's if you have to **manage data** and prepare your own datasets
      - Learn *data.table*, our preferred tool to wrangle with *large* data. Just
      search for *data.table* at datacamp.com. These are our favorites courses: [Data manipulation](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-in-r-with-datatable) and [Joining data](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-r-with-datatable).
      - Complementary to *data.table*, you should dive into *Tidyverse*, a collection of tools that will make your life much easier. This is our top-pick: [Introduction to Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse)
  - Learning your *method*
      - As soon as your data is prepped, you can start analyzing. Of course, your method is informed by your specific research question. For most students, a refresher in [regression analysis](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/multiple-and-logistic-regression) (e.g., OLS, Logit) may be exactly what they need.

Getting feedback on code or solving technical problems is crucial to your learning experience.
When working remotely, we prefer to make use of **Teamviewer**,
which allows us to *remote-control* your computer and help you right away (while you're watching, of course!).

## Installing Teamviewer

To install TeamViewer, go to the [TeamViewer homepage](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/) and download the installer for your operating system.
We recommend you to install Teamviewer *permanently*. If you do not have admin rights, it's fine to only select *run once*.

Please indicate you download Teamviewer for *private use*. We have purchased a Teamviewer license, so that we can attend your session.

**Mac users need to change additional security settings.**
After installing TeamViewer, Mac users need to change a few security settings to grant access rights (so that a team member may steer your mouse and type on your keyboard). Please [follow this guide](https://community.teamviewer.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-control-a-Mac-running-macOS-10-14-or-higher/ta-p/44699#toc-hId--1220346050).

## Starting a Teamviewer session

Open TeamViewer via the start menu, select **remote control** on the left side of your screen (it's the default), and note down **your ID** and **your password**. When talking or texting with us, please give us this ID (which is parmanent),
and your password (which is only temporary).

We can then access your computer, and you can watch us.

**Remember to change your password!**

Please change your password as soon as the session with us has ended.
To do so:

- just hover over the password area with your mouse,
- click on the little blue icon appearing on the right of it, and
- select generate a new random password.

This will keep your computer safe!

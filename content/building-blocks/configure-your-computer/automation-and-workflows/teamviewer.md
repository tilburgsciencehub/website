Getting feedback on code or solving technical problems is crucial to your learning experience.
When working remotely, you can make use of **TeamViewer**,
which allows team members to *remote-control* your computer and help you right away.

## Installing Teamviewer

To install TeamViewer, go to the [TeamViewer homepage](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/) and download the installer for your operating system.
We recommend you to install Teamviewer *permanently*. If you do not have administrator rights, it's fine to only select *run once*.

Please indicate you download Teamviewer for *private use*, unless your organization provides you with a site license.

**Mac users need to change additional security settings.**
After installing TeamViewer, Mac users need to change a few security settings to grant access rights so that a team member may steer your mouse and type on your keyboard. Please [follow this guide](https://community.teamviewer.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-control-a-Mac-running-macOS-10-14-or-higher/ta-p/44699#toc-hId--1220346050).

**Remember to change your temporary password!**

Please change your temporary password as soon as the session has ended.

To do so,

- just hover over the password area with your mouse,
- click on the little blue icon appearing on the right of it, and
- select generate a new random password.

This will keep your computer safe!

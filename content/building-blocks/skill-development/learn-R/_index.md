Chance is that sooner or later, you're going to use R - one of the (if not *the*) most popular statistical
programming languages in the world. It's not only that R is free which makes
it so good, but because thousands of people across the world use it, document it, and
develop it further.

Let us warn you: the R interface may be scary at first sight, especially
if you're used to using Excel to do your data magic. But - trust us -
investing in learning R will pay off greatly. Not only for your career at
grad school, but also for your career in industry. R (next to Python) has been
a de-facto standard when applying for jobs in marketing analytics or data
science.

One thing that's great about R is that there are tons of resources available
to learn it. Well - that brings the difficulty that you need to know which
resources to use to learn it most efficiently.

!!! tip "Learn R fast"
    Here are a few tips to learn R efficiently.

    - Have a project!

        "Huh - why to have a project? I first need to learn R!"

        Well, if you *really* want to learn R, then you should already have a project in mind that you would like to tackle. R is such a powerful tool that you would get entirely lost if you didn't actually know what you would like to accomplish.
        If you don't have a project, and still would like to learn R, we suggest you to do some googling for some interesting datasets to get you started (e.g., [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)).

    - Follow our [R/R Studio installation guide](https://hannesdatta.github.io/reproducible-science-guide/setup/r/)
    - Enroll R courses at Datacamp.com (free-to-use with a Tilburg University account!)
        - Must do's for **novices**
            - [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)
            - [Intermediate R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r)
        - Must do's if you have to **manage data** and prepare your own datasets
            - Learn *data.table*, our preferred tool to wrangle with *large* data. Just
            search for *data.table* at datacamp.com. These are our favorites courses: [Data manipulation](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-in-r-with-datatable) and [Joining data](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-r-with-datatable).
            - Complementary to *data.table*, you should dive into *Tidyverse*, a collection of tools that will make your life much easier. This is our top-pick: [Introduction to Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse)
        - Learning your *method*
            - As soon as your data is prepped, you can start analyzing. Of course, your method is informed by your specific research question. For most students, a refresher in [regression analysis](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/multiple-and-logistic-regression) (e.g., OLS, Logit) may be exactly what they need.

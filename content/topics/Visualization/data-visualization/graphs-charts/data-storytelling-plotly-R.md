## Overview

In this article, you learn how to fuse data visualization with storytelling. This integration is based on Hans Rosling's approach to data presentation. Hans Rosling, renowned for his contributions to the [Gapminder project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w), has had a profound impact on how we interpret complex global data in areas such as health, economics, and education. His method of dynamic visual storytelling has challenged and reshaped many long-standing misconceptions.

We delve into the capabilities of the `plotly` package in R, aiming to mirror Rosling's engaging narrative style in our data visualizations. We begin with the basics of the `plotly` package, highlighting its ability to transform static charts into interactive charts, complete with hover details, zoom capabilities, and adjustable scales. As we delve deeper, we'll showcase how a combination of `plotly`'and `ggplot2` transforms conventional data visualizations into interactive, dynamic experiences.

### Setup 

To begin our exploration of dynamic data storytelling in R, we will set up our environment with `plotly` and the `gapminder` dataset. This dataset, the one Rosling used, includes data on GDP, life expectancy, and population across various countries and years, making it well-suited for dynamic storytelling and analysis.

library(plotly)

# Install and Load the Gapminder Dataset
install.packages("gapminder")
library(gapminder)
gapminder_data <- gapminder::gapminder
```

## The Basics of Plotly

### Your First Interactive Plot with Plotly
To create an interactive plot with `plotly`, it's important to understand the syntax and the role of each component in the final visualization. Let's walk through this process step by step: 

1. **The `plotly` Function**:    

Start with `plot_ly()`, the primary function in `plotly` for R. This function initializes a `plotly` graph. 

2. **Data and Aesthetics**:     

The first argument in `plot_ly()` should be the data frame containing your dataset. Following that, define the x and y aesthetics with a tilde (`~`) before each variable. This notation specifies that these are variables from your dataset and determines which variables are plotted on the x and y axes.

3. **Plot Type and Mode**:    

*Type Argument*: This specifies the kind of plot you're creating. Options include '*scatter*' for scatter plots, '*bar*' for bar charts, or '*heatmap*' for heatmaps.    

*Mode Argument*: This determines the presentation style of your data points, with choices like '*markers*' for dots, '*lines*' for line graphs, or combinations such as '*markers+lines*'.

4. **Interactive Elements with Text**:

*Text Argument*: Use this to add interactive labels to your data points, visible when hovered over.

*Customizing Label Display*: You can format these labels with combinations of text, such as `text = ~paste("Country:", country, "GDP:", gdp)`.

Hover Information Control: The hoverinfo attribute, set as e.g. *'text+x+y'*, allows you to decide what information shows up in the tooltips.

5. **Layers and Traces**:   
      
Plotly visualizations consist of "traces", like lines, bars, markers, etc.
Add these elements using functions like `add_lines()`, `add_bars()`, `add_markers()`, etc.

6. **Layout and Styling for the Final Touch**:  
   
Finally, the `layout()` function is used for detailed customization. Here, you can add titles, axis labels, legends, and apply various stylistic elements to the plot. 
   
Here’s the complete code for our basis plot:

{{% codeblock %}}

```R 
# Create an interactive scatter plot
plot <- plot_ly(data = gapminder_data, 
                x = ~log(gdpPercap), 
                y = ~lifeExp, 
                type = 'scatter', 
                mode = 'markers', 
                text = ~country, hoverinfo = 'text+x+y') %>%
        layout(title = 'GDP per Capita vs Life Expectancy',
               xaxis = list(title = 'GDP per Capita'),
               yaxis = list(title = 'Life Expectancy')) 
```

**Understanding Plotly's Interactivity**

While the screenshots included serve as a helpful visual reference, they don't fully convey the interactive capabilities of `plotly`'s plots. The best way to understand these dynamic elements is to run the example code in your R environment. Engaging with the plots directly through your R setup will provide a more comprehensive understanding of `plotly`'s interactive capabilities.

### The Interactvity capabilites of Plotly
When you run the provided code in your R environment, you'll be presented with an interactive scatter plot in the viewer pane. This plot allows you to interact with the data points in several ways:

#### Hover Interactivity 
By simply moving your cursor over the markers on the plot, you activate tooltips that reveal detailed information. For instance, in our example, hovering over a point displays the respective country's name, GDP per capita, and life expectancy.

#### Zoom and Pan Capabilities
`plotly`'s zoom functionality is tailored for detailed examination of specific plot areas, especially useful in densely populated regions of the plot or when focusing on certain data ranges. You can activate zooming with a simple scroll or by selecting a specific area within the plot.

**Customizing Hover Text Boxes**

`plotly` offers the option to customize hover text boxes, enhancing both context and readability. When customizing these text boxes for your visualization, keep these key points in mind:

*Conciseness with Relevant Information:* Ensure the hover text boxes remain clear and uncluttered. Include only the most crucial data to avoid overwhelming the viewer and to facilitate quick comprehension.

*Formatting for Readability*: Utilize HTML tags for structured formatting. This approach helps to make complex data more accessible and keeps the hover text boxes organized and clean.

*Simplifying Variable Names*: For lengthy or complex variable names, consider using shorter, more intuitive aliases to enhance user-friendliness.

```R
# Create an interactive scatter plot
plot <- plot_ly(data = gapminder_data, 
                x = ~log(gdpPercap), 
                y = ~lifeExp, 
                type = 'scatter', 
                mode = 'markers', 
                text = ~paste("Country:", country,  
      # text = ~paste(...): Customizes the hover text.
                              "<br>GDP per Capita:", gdpPercap, # line breaks (<br>) for readability.
                              "<br>Life Expectancy:", lifeExp, 
                              "<br>Population:", pop),
                hoverinfo = 'text',) %>%
  layout(title = 'GDP per Capita vs Life Expectancy',
         xaxis = list(title = 'GDP per Capita'),
         yaxis = list(title = 'Life Expectancy'),
         # hoverlabel: Customizes the hover label.
         hoverlabel = list(bgcolor = "white") # Set hover label background to white
```

## Bringing Data to Life with Animations

With the basics in place, our `plotly` scatter plot currently showcases the relationship between GDP and life expectancy through interactive, hoverable points. However, the simultaneous display of data across all years can create a visually cluttered experience. The next step is to add: **_Animation_**. `plotly`'s animation capabilities can transform these static visualizations into dynamic narratives, effectively illustrating changes over time.

### Implementing Animations in Plotly
To animate data using `plotly`, there are two main steps to follow:

**Step 1: Organizing Data with the Frame Argument**

Start with setting `frame = ~<category>` in the `plot_ly()` function. where <category> is the variable you want to animate over (e.g., year, month, category). This step categorizes your data points, allowing for a sequential animation in `plotly` based on the selected category.

**Step 2: Fine-Tuning with Animation Options**

Next, apply `animation_opts(frame = <duration>, redraw = TRUE, transition = <transition_time>, easing = <easing_function>)` for detailed control over the animation:
- *frame = duration*: Determines the duration each frame is displayed, in milliseconds.
- *redraw = TRUE*: Ensures smooth transitions between frames.
- *<transition_time>*: Sets the duration of transitions between frames, adding to the animation's smoothness.
- *<easing_function>*: Selects the animation style (like linear, elastic, or bounce), which influences the motion and aesthetic feel of the animation.
  
Here’s an example illustrating how to animate our scatter plot in R using `plotly`:

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
# Integrated Example for an Enhanced Animated Scatter Plot
plot_ly(gapminder_data, 
        x = ~log(gdpPercap), 
        y = ~lifeExp, 
        frame = ~year,  # Replace 'year' with your chosen category
        text = ~paste("Country:", country, 
                      "<br>GDP per Capita:", gdpPercap, 
                      "<br>Life Expectancy:", lifeExp),
        type = 'scatter', 
        mode = 'markers',
        hoverinfo = 'text+x+y') %>%
  layout(title = 'GDP per Capita vs Life Expectancy',
         xaxis = list(title = 'GDP per Capita'),
         yaxis = list(title = 'Life Expectancy'),
         hoverlabel = list(bgcolor = "white")) %>%
  animation_opts(frame = 1000, 
                 redraw = TRUE, 
                 transition = 50, 
                 easing = 'elastic')
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/plotly-5.png" width="450">
</p>

Running this code results in an animated scatter plot that not only shows the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy but also illustrates how these variables have changed over time (or your chosen category). The inclusion of animation features significantly enhances the visualization's engagement and insightfulness, effectively narrating the story hidden within the numbers.

**Customizing the Animation**    
Improve your animated scatter plot in `plotly` by adding user-friendly interactive elements such as a **play button** and a **slider** for improved navigation and control.

```R
# Previous code %>%
  animation_opts(frame = 1000, 
                redraw = TRUE, 
                transition = 50, 
                easing = 'elastic') %>%
  animation_button(x = 1, 
                   xanchor = "right", 
                   y = 0, 
                   yanchor = "bottom") %>%
  animation_slider(currentvalue = list(prefix = "Year: "))
```

**Nessary components**

Specifying `frame = year `and `ids = country` in the plot is necessary for the following reasons:
- `frame = year`:
  - *Animation Control*: The frame attribute determines how the data is segmented for the animation. Without specifying `frame = year`, `plotly` would not know how to sequence the data over time.
  - *Temporal Sequencing*: Specifying year as the frame ensures that the plot’s animation follows a chronological order, essential for visualizing time-series data or trends over time.
- `ids = country`:
  - *Data Point Tracking*: The ids attribute provides a unique identifier for each data point. In the absence of `ids = country`, Plotly would struggle to track the continuity of a specific data point (i.e., a country) across different frames.

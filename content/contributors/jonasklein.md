I am diving into the world of AI and share my knowledge about it on the way through writing articles for Tilburg.AI. Besides all this I am skilled in Python and R. I am also learning in the field of front-end (and back-end) web-development by learning HTML and CSS in combination with Flask in Python. I am eager to learn more in these fields.

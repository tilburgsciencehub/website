				<h1 class="mb-4">About Tilburg Science Hub</h1>
				<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
				<p class="text-secondary">Tilburg Science Hub (TSH) helps individual researchers, data scientists and their teams to efficiently work on empirical research projects. Our platform provides information about workflow and data management and tutorials that teach researchers how to organize and document their data and code. That way, our research becomes sustainable and reproducible, leading to time savings and transparency.</p>

				<h3 id="why-was-ths-developed">Why was Tilburg Science Hub developed?</h3>
				<p class="text-secondary">Professional tools are tremendously helpful to carry out empirical research. Think about how much time you could save when automating your projects or debugging your projects faster! Yet, many of us face a dilemma: We know that a small investment in new skills will have big returns, but we put off making it because we lack the time to make it now. Tilburg Science Hub helps you getting started quickly.
					
				<h3 id="what-does-tsh-offer">What does Tilburg Science Hub offer?</h3>
				<p>To increase your productivity when working on empirical research projects, we provide:</p>
					
				<ul>
					<li>information on state-of-the-art tooling, all in one place,</li>
					<li><a href ='/tutorials'>tutorials</a> that get you started on larger projects,</li>
					<li><a href="/building-blocks">code snippets</a> to use in your work ("building blocks"), and</li>
					<li>many inspiring use-cases and <a href="/examples">examples</a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Our content makes it much more attractive and fun to start now, because youe initial time investment becomes smaller.</p>

				<p>Curious to learn more? Then <a href="https://tilburgsciencehub.com/tour">take a tour of Tilburg Science Hub</a> now!</p>

				<h3 id="who-is-tsh-for">Who is Tilburg Science Hub for?</h3>
				<p>Are you a research master or PhD <b>student</b>? Use Tilburg Science Hub to quickly become operational and learn not only about how to properly code a specific algorithm but also how to address specific marketing-related problems.</p>

				<p><b>Academic scholars</b>, in turn, will be able to (1) reproduce published work in a more efficient way and (2) identify code snippets that might be useful, and (3) potentially become <a href="/contributors">contributors</a> at little cost.</p>

				<p><b>Companies</b> and <b>data science enthusiasts</b> can get efficient training into state-of-the-art tooling, and access to code to their own situation.</p>

				<h3 id="who-maintains-tsh">Who maintains Tilburg Science Hub?</h3>
				<img src="/img/tsh-organization.png">
				<p>Tilburg Science Hub is an open-source project. Its development has been financially supported by <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/economics-and-management">Tilburg School of Economics and Management (2019-...).</a></p>

				<p>The project consists of:
				<ul>
					<li>A <b>Core Team</b> who manages the platform. Currently, the platform is managed by <a href="https://www.hannesdatta.com">Hannes Datta</a>, <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/t-j-klein">Tobias Klein</a>, <a href="https://lachlandeer.github.io/">Lachlan Deer</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/shrabastee">Shrabastee Banerjee</a>.</li>
					<li>A <b><a href="https://tilburgsciencehub.com/onboarding">Lab<a/></b> of Research Assistants, Teaching Assistants, and Ph.D. students who further develop the platform and support researchers with their empirical projects.</li>
					<li>A group of <b>Researchers</b> who can benefit from the support of the Lab and implement our new way of working in their research projects.</li></ul></p>

				<p>Some material is based on the fantastic (open source) works of others - see below.</p>

				<p>Want to contribute to this open-source initiative - as a researcher, student, research assistant or volunteer?
